### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Jandalslap/Jandalslap** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

👋 Hi there! I'm Stewart Austin, a passionate student pursuing a degree in IT with a major in Software Development at Wintec in Hamilton, NZ. My journey in the world of tech has led me to explore various programming languages including Java, JavaScript, C#, HTML, and PHP.

💻 I have a keen interest in web platforms, networking, and the exciting possibilities of self-hosting applications. Constantly learning and growing, I'm enthusiastic about leveraging technology to create innovative solutions and enhance user experiences.

🔭 I’m currently working on a website application package to convert a static website into a dynamic solution.

🌐 Let's connect, collaborate, and code together!
